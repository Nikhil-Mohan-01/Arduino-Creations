# Arduino Creations

Welcome to my collection of Arduino projects! This repository showcases various creations, each designed to enhance my skills and explore new ideas. Below are some of the featured projects.

## Proximity Pumpkin Project ðŸŽƒ

This project was crafted as a fun way to prepare for my school's pumpkin carving and decorating contest. The Proximity Pumpkin reacts to how close you are:

- **Up Close:** The pumpkin "gets angry" by changing the LEDs to a more intense and ominous display.
- **Far Away:** The LEDs mimic the gentle flicker of a candle, with varying brightness levels.

## Object Tracking Robot ðŸ¤–

This small robot is designed to follow a person around on flat surfaces using an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor, emulating a radar system. When connected to a computer, it can visualize the data it collects, making debugging easier.
